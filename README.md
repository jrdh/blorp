# blorp
A 'bridge' that allows socket.io websocket connections to be used from (currently) Python via redis and node.js.
Uses redis and Python's asyncio module.

## Todo
- redis connection pool
- redis connection host and port settings
- tidy (~)
- tests

## To think about...
- work out how to do cope with load balancing (almost there...)
