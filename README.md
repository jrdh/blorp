# Blorp
A 'bridge' that allows socket.io websocket connections to be used from other programming languages/processes via redis and node.js.

## Co-implementations (clients-ish, the other side of the bridge)
[blorp-python](https://github.com/jrdh/blorp-python)


## Todo
- implement dynamic namespace recognition (using redis keyspace notifcations?)
- tests
- Javascript client library (i.e. for the browser)
