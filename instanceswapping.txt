strategy:

1. stop reading messages from instance queue
2. deal with all messages in local queues
3. inform nodejs that we are going to shutdown and then shutdown
~ in nodejs ~
4. reassign all messages to new instance queues (should block any new messages being added to the instance queue that just went down)
